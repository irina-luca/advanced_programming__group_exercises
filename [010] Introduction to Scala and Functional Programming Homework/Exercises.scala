// You should work with the file by following the associated exercise sheet
// (available in PDF from the course website).
//
// The file is meant to be compiled as follows:
//
// scalac Exercises.scala
//
// or
//
// fsc Exercises.scala
//
// To run the compiled file do "scala Exercises"
//
// To load the file int the REPL start the 'scala' interpreter and issue the
// command ':load Exercises.scala'. Now you can interactively experiment with
// your code.
//
// Continue solving exercises in the order presented in the PDF file. Large
// parts of the file are commented in order to make sure that the exercise
// compiles.  Uncomment and complete fragments as you proceed.  The file shall
// always compile and run after you are done with each exercise (if you do them
// in order).  Please compile and test frequently.

// The extension of App allows writing statements at class top level (the so
// called default constructor). For App objects they will be executed as if they
// were placed in the main method in Java.
